## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Build a Docker Image

### 1. Add a Dockerfile to your project

- The `Dockerfile` defines the instructions for building the image.
- Place it in the root of your project (or in the directory you will build from).

---

### 2. Write the Dockerfile

A minimal Dockerfile typically includes:

```dockerfile
# Step 1: Start from a base image
FROM baseImage

# Step 2: (Optional) Set a working directory
WORKDIR /dir

# Step 3: Copy project files into the image
COPY . /folder

# Step 4: (Optional) Run build/install commands
RUN <your-build-command>

# Step 5: Document the port your app will use
EXPOSE port

# Step 6: Define the default runtime command
CMD ["your-program", "arg1", "arg2"]
